Some methods implemented as <STRONG>automatic software packages</STRONG> for
the stable inversion of experimental data:</H3> 
<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="lcmodel.html">LCModel:</A> for the automatic
quantification of <I>in vivo</I> proton MR spectra.
<BR>
<BR>
   <LI><A HREF="discrete.html">DISCRETE:</A> for a discrete sum of 
exponential decays.
<BR>
<BR>
   <LI><A HREF="splmod.html">SplMod:</A> for a discrete sum of 
1-parameter functions, such as convoluted exponentials in fast decay 
processes.  Global analysis of multiple (e.g., wavelength) data sets with the 
same decay constants is possible.
<BR>
<BR>
   <LI><A HREF="contin.html">CONTIN:</A> a general-purpose constrained
regularization method for continuous distributions, such as inverse Laplace
transforms in relaxation studies and in dynamic light scattering.  Examples of 
many other user-defined applications implemented by users can be found with 
<I>Science Citation Index</I>. <BR>
Constraints, such as <STRONG>nonnegativity</STRONG>, can be imposed. 
<BR>
<BR>
   <LI><A HREF="contin-cd.html">CONTIN-CD:</A> CONTIN specialized to 
multicomponent spectra, particularly to the estimation of the secondary
structure content of proteins from circular dichroism. 
<BR>
<BR>
   <LI><A HREF="contin-multiq.html">CONTIN-multiq:</A> CONTIN 
specialized to the simultaneous global analysis of dynamic light scattering 
data sets obtained at different values of the scattering vector.  It can also 
splice together multiple data sets with unknown scale factors.
