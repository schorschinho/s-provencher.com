<H3>CONTIN-multiq is a special version of CONTIN for the following
applications:</H3> 
<FONT SIZE="3">
<UL>
   <LI>It includes the Splice package (documented in the CONTIN User's
Manual), which can perform the simultanoeus global analysis of several data
sets that differ from each other only in (unknown) scale factors and in the
values of T (the independent variable, usually time) at which they have
been measured; e.g., it can &quot;splice&quot; together a series of data sets
that have been measured over different (possibly overlapping) T ranges. 
   <LI>In addition, the CONTIN-multiq package can perform a global analysis on
sets of photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) data collected at different
values of the scattering vector, q, and/or with optional user-supplied form
factors. 
   <LI>Further, it can optionally globally analyze these multi-q PCS data sets
as distributions on two grids.  One grid is the usual translational diffusion
grid.  The other grid is independent of q.
